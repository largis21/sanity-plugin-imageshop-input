# sanity-plugin-imageshop-input

> This is a **Sanity Studio v3** plugin.

## Description
This is a minimal plugin for integrating imageshop with Sanity. The plugin uses the Imageshop imagepicker iframe and is based on [This plugin](https://github.com/screentek/Sanity)
The difference between the two plugins is that Screentek's plugin actually makes a sanity image asset, while this only saves the permalink as well as some metadata.

## Installation

```sh
npm install sanity-plugin-imageshop-input
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

```ts
import {defineConfig} from 'sanity'
import {imageshopInput} from 'sanity-plugin-imageshop-input'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  plugins: [imageshopInput()],
})
```
